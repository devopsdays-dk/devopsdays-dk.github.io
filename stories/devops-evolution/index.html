<h2 id="devops-evolution">DevOps Evolution</h2>

<p class="kicker"><em>“What is DevOps?”</em> — we have discussed this since the concept hatched in ~2008, but maybe we don’t need to actually define it; just reflect on what DevOps encompasses and embrace it all in the our <em>Community of Contemporary DevOps</em></p>

<p>I set out to write this post with the intent of guiding <a href="../become-a-speaker">potential speakers</a> at our conferences in the commonly asked question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Is my topic fit for the DevOps Conference?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The post still serves that purpose but it also double a good read for <em>participants</em> at our conferences in getting a feel for what the content of our conferences could entail.</p>

<p>It even triples as an invite to <em>practitioners</em> of everyday “dev” and “ops” chores to see that their skills are indeed <em>DevOpsy</em> and unite with peer, masters and apprentices under our DevOps banner.</p>

<h2 id="the-devops-timeline">The DevOps Timeline</h2>

<p>DevOps was <em>invented</em> as Twitter hashtag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#DevOps</code> for a conference on <em>Agile Infrastructure</em> in 2009 in Ghent. Already the year after, the same recurring conference was branded as <strong>DevOpsDays</strong>. And here we are!</p>

<p>But hey: <em>“isn’t agile dead?”</em> you might ask. And if that is the case isn’t DevOps dead too then?</p>

<p>Well; <em>“NO! — no one died”</em>. But it’s right to question if DevOps is <em>the same</em> as when it was hatched in 2008 — it’s not. DevOps has evolved a lot and you have a standing invitation to join the community and both contribute and challenge the what DevOps really is.</p>

<h3 id="2008--2015-branching-strategies-and-automation-pipelines">2008 – 2015 Branching Strategies and Automation Pipelines</h3>

<p>Paul Duvall published a book “Continuos Integration” in 2007 and Humble and Farley published “Continuous Delivery” in 2010 The were both in A&amp;W’s “Marting Fowler Signature Series”. And while DevOps doesn’t have an actual widely accepted manifest like the Agile paradigm have, these two books are the closest we come to a common ground the DevOps paradigm. Due to the endorsement from Martin Fowler one of the Agile Manifesto’s Founding Fathers and a widely recognized Agile movement celebrity the tie between Agile and DevOps was undeniable — especially in the early years.</p>

<p>“CI/CD” became a synonym with DevOps. The Jenkins CI server; Kohsuke Kawaguchi’s masterpiece of a configurable and expandible Open Source build automaton platform was the most novel concept introduced to Software Development since the introduction of Object Oriented programming. Jenkins CI was forked off of Hudson in 2011. It was a story of David fighting Goliath (Kohsuke vs Oracle). <em>Everyone</em> should have Jenkins Ci server.</p>

<h3 id="2015--2020-containerization-and-num3er5--the-split">2015 — 2020 Containerization and NUM3ER5 — The split</h3>

<p>Docker was release in 2013, an astronomical evolution step in IT by itself. Cloud Native Foundation and Kubernetes were co-released in 2015 and it’s fair to say that the World hasn’t been the same since. The DevOps community was the first to embraces containerization as <em>unconditionally good</em>.</p>

<p>DevOps ❤️ Containers. Concepts like <em>Configuration as Code</em> and <em>Infrastructure as Code</em> became hot topics. Tools like Terraform and Helm emerged to make infrastructure programmable and reproducible, transforming how operations teams provisioned and managed cloud resources at scale.</p>

<p>Observability matured alongside containerization. Prometheus and the ELK stack made it possible to see into distributed systems in ways we’d never imagined. And Google’s Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) handbook in 2016 introduced a distinct philosophy that automation and data-driven operations are the path forward. DevSecOps also emerged as a trend, advocating that security couldn’t be bolted on at the end—it had to be woven through the entire delivery pipeline.</p>

<p>In the early days on the DevOps movement it attracted more “devs” and less “ops”. Now with the containerization and orchestration perspective, DevOps built a home in the Cloud and all the “ops” could see themselves as first class citizens there. Yet as cloud costs spiraled, FinOps emerged around 2019 as a counterbalance —  reminding us that fast deployment means nothing if you’re hemorrhaging money on idle resources.</p>

<p>In the early days of DevOps the sentiment was that “DevOps is a culture — breaking down silos” Gene Kim was an important avantgarde for this perspective. It was also in 2015 Gene Kim release the novel “The Phoenix Projects” which won wide recognition as the “DevOps New Testament”. We would proudly parade doctrines like “DevOps is Culture” and “DevOps is not a team — It’s a way of working”</p>

<p>In 2018 Kim joined forces with an old DevOps celeb; Jez Humble and a new protégé Nicole Forsgren — a number-crusher magician and they jointly release a new book “Accelerate” in 2018 explaining the rationale behind the <em>DevOps Research and Assessment institute</em> (DORA) report which they had released annually since 2014.</p>

<p>DORA offered a clean <em>lean</em> perspective on DevOps and Continuous Delivery. Focusing on lead-times, value stream optimization, build-quality in, Throughput and Stability advocating that we should analyze and optimize our workflows based on actual NUM3ER5 pulled from the system.</p>

<p>During this period DevOps as a concept formed two new distinct schools - on top of the already established “DevOps is CI/CD” and “DevOps is Culture” ones. We had arrived at a somewhat ambiguous point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“DevOps is CI/CD”</li>
  <li>“DevOps is Culture”</li>
  <li>“DevOps is Programmable and Immutable Infrastructure”</li>
  <li>“DevOps is lean software development stream optimization”</li>
</ul>

<p>A split was emerging. KubeCon and Cloud Native Foundation — although considered inherently <em>good</em> also offered a cleaner alternative home for all the “ops” and a good portion of them moved out of the house and never looked back.</p>

<p>The DevOps movement was once again in jeopardy of being a <em>mostly “devs”</em> community.</p>

<h3 id="2020--2023-serverless-full-stack-and-devx">2020 — 2023 Serverless, Full-stack and DevX</h3>

<p>Firebase (Google), Supabase (PostgreSQL), Cloud Functions(Azure), Lambda function (Amazon) all matured quickly in the new containerized world and soon offered a compelling NoOps alternative to <em>servers</em> without the need to become a Docker expert on the side. Embraced by millennials and zoomers who — in the mean time — had been thought in uni that full-stack=MERN<sup id="fnref:mern"><a href="#fn:mern" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> stack.</p>

<p>GitHub release CodeSpaces in 2020, a web based NoOps extension based on devcontainers (2019) also natively supported by VS Code, and myriads of other Open Source IDE spin-offs. Containers were no longer exclusive to <em>cloud</em> and <em>infrastructure</em> nerds. They regained relevance to <em>all</em> developers in an emerging Developer Experience (DevX) trend. Where event the Development environment, the IDE and the <em>workflows</em> were containerized too. The shift to remote-first work — obviously driven forcefully by the COVID pandemic — accelerated this adoption. Teams distributed across geographies embraced containerized development environments as a way to ensure consistency and reduce friction.</p>

<p>Nowadays <em>every</em> develop can hack a Docker file, setup their own declarative pipeline in yaml and deploy to some abstraction of an <em>infrastructure</em> in the cloud.</p>

<p>The DevOps proverb “You Build It You Run It” is now widely embraced even by the new generations, although not entirely the way the boomers and Gen-X that inhabited the Devops world had anticipated. The apprentice surpass the master. But hey, isn’t that what all <em>true</em> masters unselfishly hope to aspire in there apprentices?</p>

<p>The fresh blood and young minds were welcomed into the DevOps community.</p>

<p>DevOps isn’t dead — it’s simply the new normal.</p>

<h3 id="2024---i-dare-you--say-ai-one-more-time">2024 — … I Dare You — Say ‘AI’ One More Time</h3>

<p>GitHub released Co-Pilot for technical preview in February 2021 and it was made publicly available for subscriptions in June 2022. Already in 2024 both DORA, Stack Exchange and GitClear could reveal convincing statistical proof that AI is jeopardizing the overall quality of mankind’s joint codebase at a speed that no one could have predicted.</p>

<p>At the same time AI, Vibe Coding and Prompt Engineering is — apparently — enabling DevOps core values like <em>fast feedback loops with end-users</em> and <em>breaking down silos</em>, by allowing Citizen Developers and self-made hackers to produce — apparently — ruining code at a pace that also no one could have predicted.</p>

<p>Developers cry out – “code quality is as risk” and while the do, the LLM’s are improving at a speed that exceed even the most farfetched Science Fiction.</p>

<p>The “Terminator Trilogy” dystopias may turn out to be unambitious compared to real-life.</p>

<p>The DevOps community keep focus on Developer Experience and Continuous Delivery and DevOps core values like <em>maintainability</em>, <em>security</em>, <em>reliability</em> are up for being redefined in the AI era.</p>

<p>We take it on our shoulders to do that. We obviously don’t know what will hit us next, but we know that we will stay united.</p>
